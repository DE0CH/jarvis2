// The tunnel proof (router/remote.go): an OpenCode/OpenClaw session publishes its web UI through the cf-tunnel
// agent with the store `tunnel`'s Access service token, which the Worker lets register only Jarvis 2 session ids,
// and only with the router's proof for that id (x-agent-secret, which Jarvis 1's agent.js sends from
// TUNNEL_AGENT_SECRET). The proof is fetched at boot over the signed /m channel, so it never sits in the Fly
// machine config. None (the router has no key, or an older router) = no TUNNEL_AGENT_SECRET.
